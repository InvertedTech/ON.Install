# Locations Detail

Locations Detail

```csharp
LocationsDetailAsync(
    Models.Page page = null,
    Models.Sort3 sort = null,
    Models.Filter3 filter = null,
    List<string> expand = null)
```

## Parameters

| Parameter | Type | Tags | Description |
|  --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `page` | [`Models.Page`](../../doc/models/page.md) | Query, Optional | Use this field to specify paginate your results, by using page size and number. You can use one of the following methods:<br><br>> /endpoint?page={ "number": 1, "size": 50 }<br>> <br>> /endpoint?page[number]=1&page[size]=50 |
| `sort` | [`Models.Sort3`](../../doc/models/sort-3.md) | Query, Optional | You can use any `field_name` from this endpoint results, and you can combine more than one field for more complex sorting. You can use one of the following methods:<br><br>> /endpoint?sort={ "field_name": "asc", "field_name2": "desc" }<br>> <br>> /endpoint?sort[field_name]=asc&sort[field_name2]=desc |
| `filter` | [`Models.Filter3`](../../doc/models/filter-3.md) | Query, Optional | You can use any `field_name` from this endpoint results as a filter, and you can also use more than one field to create AND conditions. You can use one of the following methods:<br><br>> /endpoint?filter={ "field_name": "Value" }<br>> <br>> /endpoint?filter[field_name]=Value |
| `expand` | `List<string>` | Query, Optional | Most endpoints in the API have a way to retrieve extra data related to the current record being retrieved. For example, if the API request is for the accountvaults endpoint, and the end user also needs to know which contact the account vault belongs to, this data can be returned in the accountvaults endpoint request.<br>**Constraints**: *Unique Items Required*, *Pattern*: `^[\w]+$` |
